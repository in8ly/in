Bio: Carolyn Dawn Good was born into a rural Mennonite Community in South Western Ontario. 
Wrapped in quilts and crocheted items, threads and stitching became part of her life. 

This site is part of her art and life story and  most of all purpose. Dedicated to her ancestors, family and generations yet to arrive.
