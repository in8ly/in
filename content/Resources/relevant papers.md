Awareness of one’s own thoughts, feelings, and environment is referred to as consciousness (Natsoulas, [1997](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-04154-3#ref-CR116 "Natsoulas T (1997) Consciousness and self-awareness. J. Mind Behav. 18(1):53–74.

 Collaboration involves mutual goal understanding, preemptive task co-management and shared progress tracking. Most of human activities today are done collaboratively, thus, to integrate AI into the already-complicated human workflow, it is critical to bring the Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) perspective into the root of the algorithmic research and plan for a Human-AI Collaboration future of work.

Unlike non-agentic systems, which require constant manual input and predefined processes, Agentic AI systems are flexible, scalable, and adaptive. They understand the context of tasks, take action, and keep improving through [machine learning](https://aisera.com/blog/machine-learning/) models.
