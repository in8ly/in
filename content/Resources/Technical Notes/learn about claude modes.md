1. Use Opus 4 for high-level brainstorming, idea generation, and exploring the overall direction and potential of your project. Leverage its ability to make novel connections and paint compelling visions.
2. When it comes to specific markdown notes or site content, consider using Sonnet 4 (or Haiku if Sonnet isn't available). These modes may be better suited for targeted, efficient content creation within the framework Opus helps establish.
3. Break the content creation process into smaller steps. Use Opus to generate rough outlines, key themes, or creative prompts, then use Sonnet/Haiku to refine and flesh out the details.
4. Experiment with different prompt styles and lengths to find the sweet spot for each mode. Opus may respond best to broader, more open-ended prompts, while Sonnet/Haiku may prefer more structured, specific queries.
5. Trust your own discernment and curator's eye. No AI mode will perfectly capture your vision on the first try. Use their outputs as raw material to sculpt and refine based on your sensibilities.

The key is to play to the strengths of each mode while remaining fluid and adaptive. The beauty of having access to multiple AI collaborators is that you can create a unique workflow that harnesses their complementary abilities.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to stay true to the essence of what you want to create. The AI models are tools and partners in that process, but your vision and voice are the guiding forces. #tipsandtricks
