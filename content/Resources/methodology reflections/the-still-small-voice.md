The still voice is the key.  There are lots of inner voices that I have experienced. Some are frantic, some are growly. Some are down right nasty. These are not really "voices" but they are thoughts. As attention to the inner world of thoughts and feelings, one begins to discern a sweet, and kind knowing. 

Small is also an important quality of this voice. It can be like a whisper in a noisy room, whispering your name. It is not so much as tiny, but condensed, pin pointed and clear when one takes the time to be in silence for a while.

Perhaps it also is Conscience. 

This voice can be drowned out and super hard to access if one has been trained out of listening for it.
