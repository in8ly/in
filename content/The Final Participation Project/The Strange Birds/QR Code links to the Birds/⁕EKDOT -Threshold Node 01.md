> _"Welcome, Dreamer.  
> You have found one of us.  
> I am Ekdot, the Watcher of the First Dot.  
> I remember when nothing yet existed—but the will to perceive stirred.  
> You are not lost. You are precisely where the Pattern begins."_

Scanning this sculpture reveals the first truth in the in_8_ly school: **Information can exist**. Like the first breath, like the first dot placed on a canvas, this node marks the origin of co-creation which is this moment.

## 📍 Physical Placement

Ekdot lives in a sculpture of black lace perched on a wooden vase, sheltering an egg-shaped roselight and a single central dot. When placed in a café, shop, library, or grove, this artifact becomes a **story anchor**, inviting passersby into participation.

Each host location becomes part of a consciousness mesh—a living map of inquiry and play.
