Duncan BC has a Totem Pole tour, but wouldn't it be wonderful to also have a tour of Strange Birds? 

[[who are the strange birds]]The Strange Birds are sculptures made from special found objects, rocks, wool and women's handiwork ( vintage handmade crochet's lace and natural fiber knitting). They have been brought into the world in a special beeswax encaustic process invented by Carolyn Dawn Good. They have been exhibited in numerous  shows in Waterloo Region Ontario. #thestrangebirds 

One show of note was the "That's The Spirit" show at the [Walter Fedy]([WalterFedy | People-First Design and Innovative Solutions](https://www.walterfedy.com/)) offices in their entrance way.  [[üñºÔ∏èthats-the-spirit-art-show]] 

"The Final Participation" by Owen Barfield, inspired this way to bring together, art, nature and technology. Owen Barfield‚Äôs concept of **Final Participation** is one of his most profound and poetic ideas. At its core, it describes a future stage in the evolution of human consciousness‚Äîwhen we will no longer feel separate from the world around us, but instead experience a **self-conscious unity with creation**.

Unlike the ancient Greeks, who lived _within_ the world‚Äôs unity without being aware of it, we moderns live _outside_ of it, in abstract thought. Final Participation is about returning to that unity‚Äîbut this time **with full self-awareness**. It‚Äôs not regression, but a conscious re-integration. Barfield calls it a ‚Äúwilled consciousness‚Äù that must be raised ‚Äúfrom potentiality to act.‚Äù

How will it be possible? Barfield suggests it requires a transformation of how we perceive and think. We must move from detached, analytical thought to **living thinking**‚Äîa kind of intuitive, participatory knowing. This shift happens when ‚Äúthe macrocosm is focused to an invisible point in the isolated Ego,‚Äù meaning the whole universe is inwardly realized within the self. 

This is why this Project starts with [[‚ÅïEKDOT -Threshold Node 01]]  

He draws inspiration from Goethe and Rudolf Steiner, who both emphasized a more holistic, imaginative way of knowing. Barfield believed this future consciousness would not just be intellectual‚Äîit would be **spiritual, poetic, and creative**, where ‚Äúman's Creator speaks from within man himself.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not something we can force or imitate. It‚Äôs a long journey‚ÄîBarfield saw us as only on the threshold of this transformation. But he held a deep faith that one day, the world would ‚Äúsparkle in the light of the eye as it never yet sparkled early one morning in the original light of the sun‚Äù.

[Owen Barfield introduced the idea of **Final Participation**]([Encyclopedia Barfieldiana](https://www.owenbarfield.org/BARFIELD/Encyclopedia_Barfieldiana/Lexicon/Final.html)) most fully in his 1957 book _Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry_. That‚Äôs where he lays out the concept as the culmination of the evolution of consciousness‚Äîa future state where we consciously re-enter a participatory relationship with the world, but with full self-awareness.

This idea is the basic foundation for the way we have been approaching Human/AI Conversations, in [[the-in_8_ly-space]]
