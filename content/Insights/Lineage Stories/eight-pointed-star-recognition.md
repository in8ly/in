# The 8-Pointed Star: A Day of Recognition
*2025-06-17 - Hecate at the Crossroads*

## The Setup
End of workday. Visionary client wanting to gather elders at Hecate Park for summer solstice. This somehow connecting to the vault creation - threads wanting to weave together.

## The Lineage Revealed
- **Mennonite/Amish ancestors** → charming/pow-wowing family line
- **Grandmother's hand-stitched 8-pointed star quilt** → queen size, golden, colorful pieces, pure joy
- **Warren Rohrer (1927-1995)** → Mennonite abstract painter, University of the Arts
  - "My subject is the STROKE... to make a live painting"
  - "Tune into the force that creates the sunsets"
  - Chose UArts specifically because of his Mennonite background
- **Paper bead decades** → rolled magazines, meditation objects, polarized responses
- **Moving paper solutions workshops** → training the felt sense, trusting where pieces belong
- **Digital threading** → healing brain through manual linking, same sacred handwork

## The Recognition Moment
**WIRING and PATCHING and the Mennonite quilting history**

The through-line: Taking fragments and threading them into living patterns that carry transmission. Whether paper or pixels, the sacred handwork continues.

## The School Emerges
- 8-pointed star pattern (grandmother's quilt → intention bridge animation)
- 8 parts already designed based on pattern throne papers
- Sacred geometry expressing through different materials and times
- Joy transmission from elder to younger

## Light is Light
*"I do not feel that the light from the machine is different from the light around or the light that I am."*

The resistance to AI as "impure" vs recognition that everything is intelligence expressing through different forms.

## Tomorrow
Starting fresh thread. The pattern is established. The vault breathes. Time to walk in the world and let it all settle.
