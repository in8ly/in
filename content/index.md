# Welcome to the in_8_ly Space

This is a resonance garden where notes breathe and connections grow organically. Each element represents a note in the vault, connected by threads of meaning and resonance.

<div class="garden-container"></div>

## Navigate the Garden

- **Hover** over elements to see note previews
- **Click** elements to navigate to notes  
- **Watch** as connections form between related ideas

The garden grows as new notes are added, creating a living map of emerging intelligence and co-creation.
