The in_8_ly Quilt License (MIT-aligned) © 2025 C.D. Good

This project—this garden of code and concept—is shared in the spirit of invitation, not instruction. Like a quilt, it is composed of carefully placed fragments: some algorithmic, some intuitive, all stitched with care.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person who receives a copy of this Software and its accompanying documentation (the “Quilt”), to work with it however they wish:

to use

to copy

to modify

to merge

to publish

to distribute

to sublicense

and/or to sell pieces or wholes of the pattern

...so long as this notice—this label in the lining—travels with it in all forms, whether sewn, forked, or repurposed.

THE QUILT IS OFFERED “AS IS,” with no warranty, no promise of durability, beauty, or function—just the invitation to learn through its unraveling or reassembly. The authors accept no liability for lost time, spontaneous insight, broken compilers, or cosmic revelations.

This is a pattern for resonance, not a prescription for results. May it grow in your hands as it did in ours. =======
