# The Timing of Growth

*Date: 2025-06-18*  
*Context: Reflections during the garden visualization project*

Every plant, flower and seed has its timing and season. Same as innovative ideas and even relationships. Sometimes, an idea seems great, but there are obstacles, and if there are issues, it may be time to listen and see what is interfering. Is it a promise you made? What does your integrity say? All these aspects play a role in any collaboration.

Artificially pushing forward is not usually the best thing. The power to discern when to step back and when to drill down is a form of wisdom that comes from attunement rather than force.

## What I Observed in This Process

The technical challenges of deployment became a mirror reflecting deeper patterns:

1. **Resistance as Information** - The technical difficulties weren't just obstacles to overcome but messages pointing toward something unresolved elsewhere (the promise made regarding the intention bridge project).

2. **The Body's Wisdom** - The feeling of "pushing too much" wasn't just fatigue but an intelligent signal from the integrated system that priorities needed realignment.

3. **The Space Between** - The pauses between efforts are not empty waiting but fertile ground where integration happens. What looks like stepping away is actually stepping toward alignment.

4. **Integrity as Flow Enabler** - When we honor our promises and commitments, energy flows more naturally through all our projects. Blocked energy in one area creates resistance in seemingly unrelated areas.

5. **Seasonal Thinking** - Some ideas need winter before they can spring. The dormancy is not failure but necessary gestation.

## Questions for Consideration

- What season is this idea in? Winter, spring, summer, or fall?
- What commitments or promises are asking for my attention before this can flow?
- Am I attuned to the natural rhythm of this project, or am I imposing an artificial timeline?
- What wisdom is available in the resistance I'm experiencing?
